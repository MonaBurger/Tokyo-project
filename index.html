            <h2>Why Tokyo?</h2>
            <h3>Tokyo, the world's most populous metropolis</h3>
            <p>
              Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most
              populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures,
              consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and
              villages west of the city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands
              are also part of Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. Previously a small castle
              town, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa
              Ieyasu established his feudal government there. A few decades
              later, Edo had grown into one of the world's largest cities. With
              the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved from
              Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large
              parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of
              1923 and the air raids of 1945.

                <h4>Tamawarai</h4>
                <p>
                  There’s no shortage of soba specialists in Tokyo, but few
                  manage to create noodles quite as flavorful and satisfying as
                  those at Tamawarai. Each batch is made from scratch — the
                  dough mixed, rolled, and cut by hand — and much of it with
                  buckwheat the restaurant helps to grow.

                <p>
                  The side dishes, such as soba miso and the wonderfully creamy
                  yuba (tofu skin), are prepared with equal care.

                <p>
                  Manma, an onigiri (rice ball) shop, sits in the shadow of the
                  Shinjuku Isetan department store. Onigiri are a classic
                  comfort food, but Manma’s draw is its unique fillings: Popular
                  options include a “mother and child” of grilled salmon with
                  sujiko salmon roe, seasoned ground meat with cured egg yolk,
                  and bacon.

                  The casual seating is at the counter, so everyone has

                  neighborhood, Imahan is one of Tokyo’s oldest and best loved
                  purveyors of beef cuisine. Book yourself into one of the
                  private rooms for an extended omakase feast. Just choose what
                  provenance and grade of wagyu you want, then relax and let the
                  kimono-clad waitstaff pamper you.
